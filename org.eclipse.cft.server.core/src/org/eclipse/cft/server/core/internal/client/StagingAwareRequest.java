/**
 * 
 * Request that is aware of potential staging related errors and may attempt the
 * request again on certain types of staging errors like Staging Not Finished
 * errors.
 * <p/>
 * Because the set of client operations wrapped around this Request may be
 * attempted again on certain types of errors, it's best to keep the set of
 * client operations as minimal as possible, to avoid performing client
 * operations again that had no errors.
 * 
 * <p/>
 * Note that this should only be used around certain types of operations
 * performed on a app that is already started, like fetching the staging logs,
 * or app instances stats, as re-attempts on these operations due to staging
 * related errors (e.g. staging not finished yet) is permissable.
 * 
 * <p/>
 * However, operations not related an application being in a running state (e.g.
 * creating a service, getting list of all apps), should not use this request.
